# Static IP (aka internal IP address)
I was able to set this on my router directly. Otherwise these instructions seem solid even though they didn't work for me: https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-static-ip-address/

# PI DNS settings (somehow this got borked at one point)

# Port Forwarding
I set this up through router directly. I'm forwarding 22 for ssh, 80 for web, and 1194 for VPN

# VPN

Raspberry Pi has an ARM CPU, so I used this: https://github.com/giggio/docker-openvpn-arm. Very simple to setup, although having a VPN at my house seems useless.

# PiHole

Got this running using `docker`. Stupid router won't let me change this either. 

This looks solid: https://demyx.sh/tutorial/how-to-run-openvpn-and-pi-hole-using-docker-in-a-vps/
